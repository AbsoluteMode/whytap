# Documentation navigation

## Search order

1. Classify the question using `manifest.yaml` routes.
2. Search only routed paths with task terms, identifiers, tags, and synonyms.
3. Read the best canonical match.
4. Follow only material `related` links.
5. Check status, freshness, and sources before using a claim.

Example:

```bash
rg -n -i 'trace|tracing|observability' \
  .project-docs/services .project-docs/processes .project-docs/decisions
```

## Stopping rules

- No canonical match means unknown.
- Observations remain unconfirmed.
- Stale records require re-verification.
- Conflicts preserve every sourced version.
- Recommendations are not current behavior.
- Missing sources invalidate confirmed claims.

Record missing knowledge in `open-questions.md`; do not invent a project
default.

## Existing documentation

Historical decisions and specs remain under `docs/decisions/` and
`docs/specs/`. Search those when the routed directory has no matching record.
`agent-context.md` is the canonical source for generated repository guidance.
